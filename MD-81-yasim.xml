Airfoils are not accurately modeled; I wasn't able to find profiles, and one source
indicates they are proprietary. Not that it matters much, but I would have liked
proper profiles for the model. The profile used is a generic thin semi-symmetrical.
Update: Airfoils may be DSMA-433A/-434A at root, DSMA-435A/436A at tip.

I would prefer to divide the wing into two sections for inboard and outboard geometry,
but YASim allows only one 'wing'. I believe a vstab/mstab could be used, but YASim docs say
it isn't used by the solver computation, so for the moment I leave things simple until
my understanding improves. My single-geometry solution yields too much wing area and
too much lift aft. To compensate for the latter, I have the wing artificially placed
just under 1 meter forward of the actual position (which is not precisely known). The
position on the model is -23.034. 

Beyond basic geometry, this is guesswork. Some reports have the MD-80's as slightly
slow to roll, but that is a comparison with the smaller DC-9 which pilots say is very
responsive on the roll. Also note that though the 80's have a very slight dihedral, they
are said to be very stable on the roll axis, therefore I've increased the dihedral a bit
beyond what the model geometry suggests. I have one source that lists the dihedral as
3 degees, so this guess may be correct.

I'm not happy with the mushy stall characteristics, but in reasonable flight the plane
shouldn't get near stall conditions anyway. The MD-80's are subject to deep stalls due
to rear mounted engines and high tail configurations, and have many control and warning
measures to get the pilots into recovery mode before things get dangerous.

And with flight/ground mode distinction:

For flight operation, spoiler control value is cut by 2/3, so in effect we usually see the former
values, but when on the ground we get the latter, reflecting the setting of ground spoilers. Note
that flight mode is restricted to 50% full setting, so we in effect we only see have the former
setting in flight. See spoilers.nas for details.

Early 81's used Pratt & Whitney JT8D-209 18,500 lb (8,391 kg) and were generally considered
underpowered. Most have been upgraded to the -217 series with 20,000 lb thrust. I use the
latter as most -209's have been upgraded to -217's.

Known values for the JT8D-217:
  mass="4567" egt="625" tsfc="0.518" n1-idle="30" n2-idle="60" n1-max="99.2" n2-max="102.5"
  (tsfc based on one engine maintenance report for T/O value, tsfc=0.492 at cruise)
  oil pressure 40-55 PSI

The JT8D-217 is rated at 20000 lbs thrust at sea level and a temperature of 25C. YASim uses a
standard atmosphere temp of 15C. So, assuming a dewpoint of 0 for atmosphere density calculations,
that gives 0.0347% more thrust in YASim than indicated by the rating, or 20694 lbs. This may be
conservative based on new engine data I've not yet fully interpreted.
Authoritative sources report reversal time to be about 2 secs.
Note that the JT8D-217 has 850 lbs of reserve thrust which I currently don't factor in as I don't
know exactly how it's used; is it in addition to rated thrust, or factored into rated thrust? Using
this with the above factor would give another 880 lbs of thrust per engine (21573), but it seems to
be available only for emergency situations involving failure of one engine.

FDM throttles are mapped such that the engines idle at 7% rated thrust with throttle controls at the
full backstop.
